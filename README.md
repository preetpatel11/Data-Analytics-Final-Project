# Data-Analytics-Final-Project

1. Problem Statement:

      It predicts whether the patient has less chances or more chances of having heart attack.

2.  Dataset Description:

      I have downloaded the dataset called 'heart.csv' in which it has 14 features such as age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol, maximum heart rate achieved etc.

      Target field is in binary in which 0 shows the less chances of having heart attack and 1 shows the more chances of having heart attack.
      
      In the dataset, there are dependent variables such as age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol, maximum heart rate achieved and the slope which I have used for training the model for predicting the heart attack chances.
      
      I have spilt the data in two parts in which 80% of data is used for training and 20% data for testing.
      
3. Training Models:

      I have used 2 models. First one is Logistic Regression Model and k-NN model.
      
      For k-NN, I have used Euclidean metric.

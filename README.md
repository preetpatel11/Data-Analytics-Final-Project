# Data-Analytics-Final-Project


 â€¢ Summary:

The problem statement is that it predicts whether the patient has less chances or more chances of having heart attack.

I have downloaded the dataset called 'heart.csv' in which it has 14 features such as age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol, maximum heart rate achieved etc.
 
Target field is in binary in which 0 shows the less chances of having heart attack and 1 shows the more chances of having heart attack.
     
For training the model, I have spilt the data in two parts in which 80% of data is used for training and 20% data for testing and I have used 2 models, First one is Logistic Regression Model and k-NN model, For k-NN, I have used Euclidean metric.

In the conclusion, I have attached code file in which it shows the results along with its descritpion and visualization of the dataset.
